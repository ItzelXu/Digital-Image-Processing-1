## 32-Improved-CNN-On-MNIST-Dataset

1. Python files can be directly run from the computer's python or can be run from Google Colaboratory. All the experiments were run in Google Colaboratory since it takes less time. 

2. The Runtime settings were made as below:
   - Runtime Type: Python 2
   - Hardware Accelerator: GPU

3. For initial setup of Google Colaboratory with Keras, the steps given in this link was followed (https://medium.com/deep-learning-turkey/google-colab-free-gpu-tutorial-e113627b9f5d)

4.  From system's command prompt or Google Colab command prompt type the below commands

```
	$ python architecture_1.py
	$ python architecture_2.py
	$ python architecture_3.py
	$ python architecture_4.py
	$ python architecture_5.py
	$ python plot_curves.py
```
